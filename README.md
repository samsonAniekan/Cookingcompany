## Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the medical insurance cost for individuals based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model provides insights into how different factors influence insurance premiums.

Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns

Feature engineering to enhance predictive accuracy

Model selection and training using regression techniques

Model evaluation using key performance metrics

Deployment of the model via a web application (optional)

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

Age: Age of the insured individual

Sex: Gender of the individual (male/female)

BMI: Body Mass Index

Children: Number of dependent children

Smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes/no)

Region: Residential region of the individual

Charges: Medical insurance cost (target variable)

Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Model: Linear Regression, Random Forest, or other regression models

Deployment: Flask (optional for web application)

Steps to Run the Project
